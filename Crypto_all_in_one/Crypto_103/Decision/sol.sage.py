    """Solve an arbitrary system of modular linear equations over different moduli.

    equations: A sequence of (lhs == rhs, M) pairs, where lhs and rhs are expressions and M is the modulus.
    bounds: A dictionary of {var: B} entries, where var is a variable and B is the bounds on that variable.
        Bounds may be specified in one of three ways:
        - A single integer X: Variable is assumed to be uniformly distributed in [0, X] with an expected value of X/2.
        - A tuple of integers (X, Y): Variable is assumed to be uniformly distributed in [X, Y] with an expected value of (X + Y)/2.
        - A tuple of integers (X, E, Y): Variable is assumed to be bounded within [X, Y] with an expected value of E.
        All variables used in the equations must be bounded.
    verbose: set to True to enable additional output
    lll_args: Additional arguments passed to LLL, for advanced usage.

    NOTE: Bounds are *soft*. This function may return solutions above the bounds. If this happens, and the result
    is incorrect, make some bounds tighter and try again.

    Tip: if you get an unwanted solution, try setting the expected values to that solution to force this function
    to produce a different solution.

    Tip: if your bounds are loose and you just want small solutions, set the expected values to zero for all
    loosely-bounded variables.
